      "description": "Date sugar is a natural nutrient extracted from additive free date concentrate extraction. Its appearance is completely transparent and the color is bright to deep yellow. The product processing includes extraction, clarification, concentration, additional clarification and filtration which are not done for date syrup. By clarification, insoluble, soluble (colorful), semi-soluble (pectin) substances are removed. Date sugar contains sugars such as fructose and glucose and a trace of others which might be an alternative to other sweeteners especially natural honey. Sweetening level of date fructose is 1.2 times more than sucrose resulting in the weight decrease in its industrial consumption at the same Brix. Therefore it is competitive to other sweeteners commercially.",

      "benefits": "<ul><li><strong>Boost Immune System</strong></li></ul><p>One of the most powerful plant alkaloids in Barberry bark is “berberine”. This phytonutrient is responsible for many of its benefits. Berberine has been shown to stimulate the immune system by activating the macrophages that devour harmful micro-organisms. It is naturally antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal. The berries of the Barberry are naturally diuretic and high in vitamin C. The diuretic action allows the body to flush out bacteria, whilst the vitamin C content supports and boosts the immune system in its efforts to fight off infection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Digestive Health</strong></li></ul><p>A healthy digestive system is the cornerstone of vibrant health, allowing the body to absorb nutrients fully and to expel waste efficiently. The bitter alkaloids found in the barberry stimulate and regulate the digestive system and aid in the secretion of bile, which is good for liver health.</p><p>Berberine also acts as a mild purgative which makes Barberry highly effective for constipation.</p><p>Studies show that Barberry outperforms antibiotics cases of gastro-intestinal problems, possibly due to its astringent effects. It has also been shown to clear up bacterial diarrhea without any negative side effects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Bladder/Urinary Health</strong></li></ul><p>Barberry has a powerful antibacterial action which supports to combat bacterial Urinary Tract Infections. Research now shows that berberine is effective for UTIs due to its ability to inhibit bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells (the cells lining the surface of the urinary bladder). Barberry has been found to be particularly effective in preventing E coli from binding to urinary tract cells. As an anti-inflammatory, Barberry will also soothe an inflamed urinary tract.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Help manage diabetes</strong></li></ul><p>Barberries — and in particular their berberine content — may play a role in managing diabetes, which is a chronic disease marked by high blood sugar levels. Specifically, berberine has been shown to improve how the cells respond to the hormone insulin, which regulates the amount of sugar in the blood. In turn, this may help lower the blood sugar levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Good for dental health</strong></li></ul><p>Test-tube studies have shown that barberry extract can fight inflammation. This is because berberine acts as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent. Therefore, it may help treat inflammatory dental diseases like gingivitis, which is marked by plaque build-up, swelling, and irritation of the gums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Have anticancer effects</strong></li></ul><p>There are several different ways in which barberries may exert anticancer effects, all of which are related to berberine. Since berberine acts as an antioxidant, it may help fight underlying oxidative damage associated with cancer development.</p><p>Additionally, berberine may cause cancer cell death, prevent cancer cell replication, and inhibit enzymes involved in the life cycle of cancer cells.</p><p>Several test-tube studies have shown that berberine prevents tumor growth and initiates cell death in human prostate, liver, bone, and breast cancer cells.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Could Help You Lose Weight</strong></li></ul><p>Metabolic syndrome is a combination of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess belly fat, and abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The dietary fiber found in barberry is great to bind unnecessary cholesterol in the intestine. This will promote and optimize the production of good cholesterol to control cholesterol level and lead to lose weight.</p>",

      "benefits": "<ul><li><strong>Boost Immune System</strong></li></ul><p>One of the most powerful plant alkaloids in Barberry bark is “berberine”. This phytonutrient is responsible for many of its benefits. Berberine has been shown to stimulate the immune system by activating the macrophages that devour harmful micro-organisms. It is naturally antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal. The berries of the Barberry are naturally diuretic and high in vitamin C. The diuretic action allows the body to flush out bacteria, whilst the vitamin C content supports and boosts the immune system in its efforts to fight off infection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Digestive Health</strong></li></ul><p>A healthy digestive system is the cornerstone of vibrant health, allowing the body to absorb nutrients fully and to expel waste efficiently. The bitter alkaloids found in the barberry stimulate and regulate the digestive system and aid in the secretion of bile, which is good for liver health.</p><p>Berberine also acts as a mild purgative which makes Barberry highly effective for constipation.</p><p>Studies show that Barberry outperforms antibiotics cases of gastro-intestinal problems, possibly due to its astringent effects. It has also been shown to clear up bacterial diarrhea without any negative side effects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Bladder/Urinary Health</strong></li></ul><p>Barberry has a powerful antibacterial action which supports to combat bacterial Urinary Tract Infections. Research now shows that berberine is effective for UTIs due to its ability to inhibit bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells (the cells lining the surface of the urinary bladder). Barberry has been found to be particularly effective in preventing E coli from binding to urinary tract cells. As an anti-inflammatory, Barberry will also soothe an inflamed urinary tract.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Help manage diabetes</strong></li></ul><p>Barberries — and in particular their berberine content — may play a role in managing diabetes, which is a chronic disease marked by high blood sugar levels. Specifically, berberine has been shown to improve how the cells respond to the hormone insulin, which regulates the amount of sugar in the blood. In turn, this may help lower the blood sugar levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Good for dental health</strong></li></ul><p>Test-tube studies have shown that barberry extract can fight inflammation. This is because berberine acts as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent. Therefore, it may help treat inflammatory dental diseases like gingivitis, which is marked by plaque build-up, swelling, and irritation of the gums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Have anticancer effects</strong></li></ul><p>There are several different ways in which barberries may exert anticancer effects, all of which are related to berberine. Since berberine acts as an antioxidant, it may help fight underlying oxidative damage associated with cancer development.</p><p>Additionally, berberine may cause cancer cell death, prevent cancer cell replication, and inhibit enzymes involved in the life cycle of cancer cells.</p><p>Several test-tube studies have shown that berberine prevents tumor growth and initiates cell death in human prostate, liver, bone, and breast cancer cells.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Could Help You Lose Weight</strong></li></ul><p>Metabolic syndrome is a combination of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess belly fat, and abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The dietary fiber found in barberry is great to bind unnecessary cholesterol in the intestine. This will promote and optimize the production of good cholesterol to control cholesterol level and lead to lose weight.</p>",

An excellent source of essential nutrients, these tasty vegetables are a vital part of a healthy diet now and during emergencies. Great for casseroles, soups, and as a tasty side dish. Freeze-drying is our preferred method for long term storage of green beans. We use this approach to maximize flavor and to preserve the best texture as well.\n\nAlso, because of their rich green color, we don't always think about green beans as providing us with important amounts of colorful pigments like carotenoids. But they do! Recent studies have confirmed the presence of lutein, beta-carotene, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin in green beans.",

      "description": "Freeze Dried Broccoli is light and crisp, and still has all the same nutrition and taste of broccoli in its original fresh state. You can use them for any application that calls for chopped broccoli. The size of the broccoli pieces are great for side dishes, casseroles, stir fry, soups and more. The possibilities are endless! They are produced in a process where moisture is removed from the product using a very low temperature and a vacuum. Only about 3-5 percent moisture remains in the product at the time of packaging. The end product weight is reduced by over 90 percent, while the volume stays the same. This remarkable process concentrates the fresh taste, natural color, and texture of mushrooms. When rehydrated, the product will absorb the liquid and resemble fresh broccoli once again. The taste is great, and the nutritional value is preserved. Freeze drying provides natural and additive free vegetables to be stored effectively for long periods of time.",
